Better Editor (QGIS plugin)
===
![Icon](./icon.png)

This plugin improves the embedded Python editor with several useful features.

- Smart autocompletion and call tips with Jedi
![jedi](./docs/jedi.gif)

- Replace comment / uncomment action with a single well-behaved Toggle comment action (`Ctrl+:`)

![toggleComment](./docs/toggle.gif)
- Format code with [black formatter](https://github.com/psf/black) (`Ctrl+Alt+F` or Format on save)

![formatCode](./docs/black.gif)
- Better handling of `[{('""')}]` : automatic insertion and deletion
- Goto definition: press F12 or F2 will go to the definition of the word under the cursor (works only within the script)
- Insert icon from QGIS resources: useful for quick prototyping
- Tweak some QGIS shortcuts which prevented user from entering `}` and `|` in the console when keyboard used AZERTY (French) layout
- Pressing Ctrl+S and Ctrl+Shift+S triggers file save when editor has focus
- Pressing Ctrl+R triggers script run
- Tab navigation with `Ctrl+PgDown` and `Ctrl+PgUp`
- Multiple syntax error check with [jedi](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi).
